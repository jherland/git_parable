#The Git Parable - in presentation form

These are slides for a presentation/talk adapted from Tom Preston-Werner's essay "The Git Parable": http://tom.preston-werner.com/2009/05/19/the-git-parable.htm

I've given the talk a few times, with generally positive feedback:

- NDC TechTown 2018 (August 2018, Kongsberg, Norway): https://youtu.be/jm7QsI-nNjk
- ACCU 2013 (April 2013, Bristol, UK): http://www.infoq.com/presentations/git-details
- Meetup with the local Tekna chapter (October 2012, Oslo, Norway).
- Various company-internal meetings at Opera (2009-2010) and Cisco (2012-2021)

Matthew Brett has remixed some of my slides/illustrations into Preston-Werner's original essay: http://practical-neuroimaging.github.io/git_parable.html

Also, I have redone the slides for the 2018 talk in Google Docs: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1u0cM0r07iL9v7Myo6RWGWRR3o2IYlebDIayG8rMagVw/edit
